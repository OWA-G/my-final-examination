                    THE CONCEPT OF GIT AND GITHUB

GIT - is a type of version control system (VCS) that makes it easier to track changes to files.
    - For example, when you edit a file, git can help you determine exactly what changed, who changed it, 
      and why.


GITHUB - is a website and cloud-based service that helps developers store and manage their code, as well 
         as track and control changes to their code.
       - is a lightweight, branch-based workflow that supports teams and projects where deployments are 
         made regularly.
