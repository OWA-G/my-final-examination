                    THE IMMPORTANCE OF GIT AND GITHUB
                    
GIT - is its branching capabilities. Unlike centralized version control systems.
    - does not rely on the central server; that is why, there is no need to interact 
      with the remote server for every operation.
    - the chances of losing data are very rare when there are multiple copies of it.
    - uses a common cryptographic hash function called secure hash function (SHA1), 
      to name and identify objects within its database.
    - is also a free and open-source distributed version control system.
    - it was created by Linus Torvalds in 2005.

GITHUB - is a cloud-based hosting service for Git repositories. 
       - is a tool build on the top of Git. In simple terms.
       - it provides a graphical interface that interacts with Git repositories. 
       - it makes it easier for the individual and team to use Git for version control. 
       - provide collaboration features such as task management, bug tracking and feature 
         request for every project. 
       - can be use through a web portal or desktop GUI or Git shell.
